Let's begin development of Gleam House!

{
First thing to do is:
    1. Create an infinite grid with a checkered pattern, that will be world's "floor"
(refer to dev_plan.txt)

Let's create a class
    class Floor
in new files
    Floor.h
    Floor.cpp

    {
    Now I noticed that all our source code is in
        namespace Demo
    because I copied the setup from one of Pekan's demos.
    Let's just replace
        namespace Demo
    with
        namespace GleamHouse
    everywhere.
    }

By the way, we don't need the GUI window at all. Let's remove it. Done.

Found a bug in Pekan causing the second RectangleShape rendered in a Floor
to take the color of the first RectangleShape rendered,
if the floor is too big (81x81 or more).
Fixed it in Pekan.
Updated the Pekan dependency here.
Now it works.

Floor is ready.
We have a grid with a checkered pattern.
It's not infinite, but we can make it as big as we want to fit the whole level.

Done.
}

{
Next thing to do is
    2. Create player's character
        2.1. Render a small sprite
        ...

First, create a texture to be used for player's sprite
    src/resources/GleamHouse_player.png

Then, let's create a new class
    class Player
in new files
    Player.h
    Player.cpp
and make it render a sprite using the image as a texture.

    {
    Added this CMake option
        GLEAMHOUSE_WITH_DEBUG_GRAPHICS
    to be able to easily enable and disable debug graphics.
    For now the only debug graphics that we have is the tiny red square marking coordinate system's center.
    I don't want to see it by default so this new option will be disabled by default.
    }

Looks good.
Done.
}
